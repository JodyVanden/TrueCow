  <h2>Problem you could have when you buy a car</h2>
    <p>The initial purchase price of a car is only one part of the cost. A key question is whether you can afford the drip, drip of maintenance and repairs for as long as you own it. <br>

    <p>Research shows ownership costs are relatively low during year 1 to year 3 due to free maintenance/warranty eg. BMW, Mini but jacks up once the warranty and free maintenance periods are over. <br>

    <p>There are several out of pocket costs eg. insurance, fuel, repairs, financing, maintenance over the course of ownership (3-5 years typically) <br>

    <p>Even if 2 vehicles priced the same, it doesnâ€™t mean they will cost the same over time. Knowing 3 year cost to own ahead of time can help you save money. <br>

    Social and environmental benefits of owning a new car will decrease the average age of the cars on the road
